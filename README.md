<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I recently started using an old soundbar as my speakers for my PC.  Only to realise it has an "auto sleep" function that I cannot adjust or disable.  The workaround for this would be to simply make sure that audio is sent to the sound output before it goes to sleep.
I did find one alternative app searching the web, but I did not want to download and install it, since both Chrome and Windows identified it as having a Trojan.  Might be a false alarm, but I'd rather not take the chance. 

I figured, I might as well just create my own, and make some improvements to the existing app (as described).

This little app does the following:
* Monitors audio levels on the default output device, and if no output is detected in a 10-minute period, it will play a sound.
* The Sound is not an embedded wave file, but the waveform is generated in code.  Saves some size, and makes it more flexible
* The sound is a 10Hz sine wave, imperceptible to human hearing (for most).
* To sound volume is ramped up, and then down, to make sure there are no START/STOP "pops". Some digital devices will manifest this.
* The app has a Tray Icon, and a Settings window (nothing in there yet)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Download the Zip File containing the latest [Release](https://github.com/tiaanv/SBKA/releases), or get the source, and build it yourself.
Run the app.  You may also add a shortcut to your windows startup folder..

When you run the app, it will immediately start working. a Icon will appear in Tray Icons list.  Right Clicking on the Tray Icon presents a menu. from here you can:
* Exit -> Close the application
* Settings -> Presents the Settings window. This only shows the last time sound was detected, and the last time sound was played (for now).  Will add settings if it gets requested by users.

### Installation


1. This is a Portable App, so no installation is required.
2. Simply copy all the files into a folder on your computer an run it from there.
